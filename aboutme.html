<h1>My Passion, Goals, and Journey</h1>

<p>My journey in the world of technology began with a deep fascination for how systems work behind the scenes. Over time, this interest transformed into a commitment to learn programming, data structures, and software architecture.
My goal is to grow into a skilled software engineer who can contribute to impactful projects in fields such as web development, AI, and scalable system design. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and building—not just to improve myself, but to create tools and experiences that help others.</p>
